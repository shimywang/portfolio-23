            This project was launched at the end of 2021, when it became very clear that EVs 
            (electric vehicles) might soon replace fuel cars in the near future. However, there 
            wasn’t a clear answer of how EVs will be and how mobility will become. 
          </p>

          <p class = "normaltext mb-3">
            It made us wonder:
            <br>
            <b>How would vehicles become in the future?</b>
          </p>
            
          <p class = "normaltext mb-3">
            -Will it remain to be something very similar to fuel cars?<br>
            -Or, will it transfer into something completely different?
          </p>

             <p class = "normaltext mb-5">
            This is an internal project, aiming to showcase our future clients of using novel methodologies to explore even further future, and provide brand new insights and inspirations to the industry, which might support product strategy in a longer run and generate innovative solutions.

  <div class = "textcontainer mb-5">

    <p class = "normaltext mb-3">
      To build up in-depth future scenarios, 
      we used scenario planning, scenario building and design fiction.</p>

      <p class = "normaltext mb-3">
        By scenario planning, we get multiple predictions of the future marco society, which we extend to a set of scenarios that represent multiple different possible futures. In order to help reader to better emphasize the possible future world, we use scenario building to create future scenarios &future personas, illustrating future world in micro level with more details.

      </p>
     
      <p class = "normaltext mb-5">
        With descriptions of future scenarios from both marco and micro level, we emphasize and analyze possible opportunities for future mobility products. Besides, we also use design fiction to create vivid stories on how future mobility products/services could be used, which are used for illustrate their key values and a tool for further decision-making.

      01 Starting from presents, collect future drives
    </h4>
    <p class = "normaltext mb-5">
      We used PESTEL Model to collect current trends. After analyzing these collected trends, we determined future drives, 
      that might impact the organization and its future decision. Below are the six dimensions of trends from PESTEL model.
    </p>

    <img class="img-fluid mb-5 d-block mx-auto"  src="../img/pestel-model.svg" alt="">
    
    <p class = "normaltext mb-5">
      Below are two samples of our collected future drives.
    </p>

    <div class = "reflection-card mb-5" style = "background-color: #E2ECFF;border-radius: 20px;">
      <h6 class = "title-card">SOCIAL: Diversification of family structure, emerging new relationship of living together</h6>
      <p class = "normaltext">
        In future, traditional family might be replaced by a new form of cohabitation relationship. 
        Living together does not mean that you need to get married or involved in any further relationship, 
        but simply just a companion for each other, playing together and sharing risks.
        <br><br>
        There are multiple reasons for such non-traditional cohabitation, such as to reduce risk, or the desire 
        of getting connected to someone else.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "reflection-card mb-5" style = "background-color: #E2ECFF;border-radius: 20px;">
      <h6 class = "title-card">ECONOMIC: Low desire society is coming. Future young generation will have lower desire and ability to consume</h6>
      <p class = "normaltext">
        With frequent natural disaster, world-wide pandemic and turbulent international situation, it is clear 
        that the global economic will move to a downturn. Such external influences will further cause the consumption 
        ability and desire of future young generation fall further, and therefore drastically affect future consumption habits.
        <br><br>

        Furthermore, the aging of Chinese society is also speeding up. It is predicted that in 2030, aging group of 35-44, 
        and a more senior group of above 55, would be the main consumers in China. On the other hand, the proportion of total 
        consumption from young people under 35 would drop significantly.

          <p style = "font-size: 0.8rem;line-height: 1.2rem;">
            Over the past 30 years, the increasing influx of people into cities has made 
            urban personal living space even more cramped and tiny. 
            <br><br>
  
            The new countryside, with its natural beauty and convenient public services, 
            has become the most attractive place to live for city dwellers.
            <br><br>
            The new generations are moving away from their cities. They see villages as the new 
            trending place, with large space and modern facilities, yet diverse natural landscapes.

          <p style = "font-size: 0.8rem;line-height: 1.2rem;">
            The new generation finally burned out in 2035. These young people has find out that, 
            no matter how hard they work, most people can only get an average job at an average pay. 
            Therefore, it is not worthy to live an old life as their previous generations - worked hard 
            and get a promising future, as there is no such promises anymore.
            <br><br>
  
            Most young people will consider work to be just work, as there is almost no hope of getting 
            promoted or increased salary by simply devoting to works. 
            <br><br>
            
            Therefore, youths has chosen to lower their expectation in their career, that they don’t 
            expect to make a lot of money, but rather consider ‘am I happy or not with this job’ as 
            their key career criteria.

            For these people who have only been living in cities, countryside is an unknown world. 
            Although they claim to yearn for countryside life, they only yearn for the good side: 
            the beautiful scene, and low-density housing. They need products to help them to finish 
            the connection between their city life and village life, to help them finish hard labor works, 
            or lead a modern life.

            ...they make the most of the mobility ability of vehicles, and create their own miniaturized and movable necessities. 
            Wherever they move, wherever these devices could be, making everywhere their most comfy habitats.
