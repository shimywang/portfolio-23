          It is always hard to find courses to take when you literally have now idea about what the course is going to be about, what kind of pre-requisites you need to have before taking part in it. But that is what's happening everyday in Wuhan University. It is natural to think about building a platform where students can share their comments on courses and gather information.

         The information offered by school to select elective courses is hard to read. Informations offered by the system is only  about the name ,time and place of the courses. Students are hard to make desicion with only course names.

         And there are more questions when trying to select exactly 6 courses out of 300+ different courses.

          The main design before I took over Taokela is showned as follow, designed by Zixuan Wang in 2012. It was quite simple and part of the design hadn't been carried out as the existed service. As the university also redesign the study system, many information need to be renewed.

          Since we’ve received a great deal opinions on our index, we decided to make an interview to know what else should we do. We’ve interviewd first-year and second-year undergraduates who are the main group selecting elective courses in Wuhan University(WHU), and who hadn’t used Taokela before so they would not have any knowing of how our landing page work.<br>
<br>
And here’s some of the questions we prepared for the interview.
         </p>

         <p class = "normaltext" text = "ont-weight-light mb-0" >
         After interviewed to 6 radom students in the teaching building, we’ve got some answers here:
         </p>

         <p class = "normaltext" text = "ont-weight-light mb-0" >
         4 out of 6 interviewees cannot get to know the ball in the left is a kind of guide to those courses which are most chosen by others students, and considered it a kind of pretty ugly decoration.
         </p>

         <img class="img-fluid mb-5 d-block mx-auto" src="src/research2.png" alt="">


         <p class = "normaltext" text = "ont-weight-light mb-0" >
         Only 2 of these students told us they had a Renren acount, so it seems unwise to use Renren account to login.
         </p>

         <p class = "normaltext" text = "ont-weight-light mb-0" >
         Half ot them don’t know they could search for courses even though they didn’t login.
         <br><br>
         Below is the first version I designed for the landing page. To make it more clear, I removed the ball in the left, which is thought to be hard to understand, and redesign illustrations in a flatter style. Also, I’ve made the login more clear.Entrance for searching without login was also added beneath the login button to give better instuructions.
         </p>

         <img class="img-fluid mb-5 d-block mx-auto" src="src/index_v1.png" alt="">

         <p class = "normaltext" text = "ont-weight-light mb-0" >
       The landing page was improved to be a more simple way, I removed those illustrations in the left, since we were getting more users and considered it useless to give such imformation known or could be easily guessed by our users.and make it more suitable to the new banner.
         </p>

         <p class = "normaltext" text = "ont-weight-light mb-0" >
       The third version is newly built in May 2016, I redesign the logo for Taokela and thus I change the banner to make them suit each other, and also bring some feelings of summer(with the girl on the top).This version’s index is also simplified to give more strength to login, with less things disturbing.

          The schedule in the midle here is being redesigned in a more clear way with vivid color,giving more instructions about your available time.Some parts of the left column was deleted because they are not so reasonable to being there, and a new entrance for searching for courses has been added to help get quick entrance to the searching.page.The search bar on the top had also been changed into a more out-standing color to attract attention. New column about the total amount of credits you’ve got (which was not being shown officially) has been added to help get a better plan about possible choice.

         Below is a whole-new page for your selection list. Users can switch between their lists and schedule. Courses you’ve clicked a “heart” could been seen here, and I also offer a tag with different color to help users to get a quick recall of details of their selected courses.

         A list for selecting courses is also offered here, and users could see it in the sequence of their time, courses selected here will be sent to the school’s system as their selections. It also offered a service to send some courses as your request everyday during the selecting period, so you don’t have to do it yourself everyday.

          The area for comments and area for discussion was eliminated into only one area, because they are considered to be almost the same thing. And the form of how the ranking chat would be shown is being redesigned to using only one main color.

          hen the redesign for the website was started, there were only 400 less users per day during the selecting period, and when the first version had been released, we got more users than expected. The team is still working tto offer a better service. In 2016, Taokela even cooperated with Xianyu(which belongs to Taobao) to hold a second-handed market in the campus.
          <br>
<br>
This was the first complete project I’ve been done with a complete team.Although there was some deficiency, it was the first time I learned how to cooperate with product manager and developers, getting real connections with our users.
