        <h3 class="text-secondary section-title mb-5"><span class = "primary-color-text">1 </span>Thinking on the problem</h3>
        <div class = "textcontainer mb-5">
          <p class = "normaltext mb-5">
            Our main focus on this project is to <b>innovate on the wall ovens for online channels</b>. To answer this question, we have two key problems to focus on:
          </p>
          <h4 class = "sub-title mb-3">01 How do online customers purchase wall ovens?</h4>
          <p class = "normaltext mb-5">
            With the blooming of e-commerce in China, there are more customers rely heavily on online shopping and get used to finishing all purchase steps, 
            from knowing the product to purchasing the product online. Compare to the traditional shopping decision-making process,
            below are the two main different decision-making model of today’s new customers compare to the traditional model:
          </p>
          <h4 class = "sub-title mb-5">I. Even shorter decision-making time: They buy when they know it</h4>

          <img data-aos="fade-up" class="img-fluid mb-5 d-block mx-auto"  src="../img/oven-customer-type-1.svg" alt="">

          <h4 class = "sub-title mb-5">II. Even longer decision-making time: Compare everything on social media</h4>

          <img data-aos="fade-up" class="img-fluid mb-5 d-block mx-auto"  src="../img/oven-customer-type-02.svg" alt="">

          <h4 class = "sub-title mb-5">02 What are the differences between single product consumer & range hood sets consumer?</h4>
          <p class = "normaltext mb-5">
            It’s much more convenient to purchase home appliances as a set than selecting every single
             product from multiple different brands.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, as we aim at increasing sales of single product, we need to create really attractive product, 
            that can differentiate from other products or brands so that customers are willing to buy the
             single product with extra efforts.
          </p>

    <p class = "normaltext mb-4">

      This new product should be able to quickly attract consumers

       any helps from offline channel, which can be solved by creating 
       features from the two following aspects.

  <h3 class="text-secondary section-title mb-5"><span class = "primary-color-text">4 </span>Outcome</h3>
  <div class = "textcontainer mb-5">
    <h4 class = "sub-title mb-3">Focus on the full experience while cooking</h4>
    <p class = "normaltext mb-5">
      Although cooking appliance serve mainly for cooking delicious food, but users are not 
      only focusing on how delicious food they could make. Their needs and experience towards 
      these cooking appliance also includes:
      <br><br>

      <b>Experience while using it</b> - Are they easy to use, which includes:
      <br>

      1.Interacting with its controller parts for adjusting time &temperature: 
      e.g. How to adjust? Is it easy to adjust?
      <br><br>

      2.Interaction with the machine while cooking: e.g.  How to open the oven? How’s the experience of putting food into the oven?
      <br><br>

      <b>Its appearance </b>- How does it look? Does it fit in with my home?
    </p>

    <h4 class = "sub-title mb-3">Concepts launched</h4>
    <p class = "normaltext mb-5" style = "font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">
      1. Between touch screen and knob
      </p>
      <p class = "normaltext mb-5" >
        Users mostly start to adjust settings or select cooking modes after they’ve finished 
        pre-processing their food. However, as their hands are often wet and dirty at this time, 
        it is much more complicated for them to use touch screen because they need to consequently 
        wipe or clean up their hands. 
        <br><br>

        In addition, most users want to be able to finish adjusting settings as soon as possible, 
        while these wall-ovens often provide a wide range and delicate way to adjust, such as adjusting 
        temperature from 30°C to 230°C by 1°C, or adjusting cooking time from 1 min to 180 mins by 1min, 
        making users hard to achieve their goals.
        <br><br>

        Users need a quicker and simpler way to control their ovens. Although touch screen was 
        the absolute mainstream at that time, it requires users to click several dozens of times 
        for setting up.  However, for the traditional knobs, they still stands for the out-dated 
        products to user. Users still wish to have the element of digital screens to showcase their 
        high-end product is smart and used advanced technology, while they also want a quicker and 
        easier way to control their machine.
        <br><br>

         Therefore, we have come up with the idea to combine knob with digital screens. 
         This new Smart knob allows user to use rotary knob to quickly select modes and adjust settings, 
         which is much quicker than pointing at screens, its screen on the knob tells clearly what users 
         select, which helps user to control in a easier and more precise way, while providing a ‘smarter’ 
         feeling of interaction to users.

      </p>

      <p class = "normaltext mb-5" style = "font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">
        2. Cooling down steam
        </p>

      <p class = "normaltext mb-5" >
        When coming to user experience, it is also about how users interact with the machine while cooking, 
        which might not be directly connected to how good your food taste. 
        <br>
        <br>

        Most products would keep their focus on how better foods could be with larger volume steams. However, 
        larger volume steam also comes with a worse user experience. When opening the oven for taking food, 
        there is always hot steam spilling out of the oven and running directly into users’ face. What’s worse, 
        there are steam, which could have very high temperature, escaping from oven during the long cooking process 
        even though the door is perfectly closed, making the oven the worst place to stand close by or walk around. 
        In summary, users have really bad experiences in the following 3 circumstances: when taking/putting food, when 
        observing the cooking status, and when moving around in their own kitchen while the machine is working.
        <br>

        It is valuable to work further on how to relieve the pain of being affected by the spilled steam. 
        For experienced users, they can easily imagine the scenario of how annoying the spilled steam is, 
        and get attracted to the product on how this feature could make their cooking life easier. With such 
        feature and strategy of continually emphasizing and working further on the steam problem, we think there 
        might be a higher possibility for our customers to better differentiate from competitors and stand out.

        3. Adding value to ovens: externalize its cooking ability
        </p>

      <p class = "normaltext mb-5" >

        Wall oven takes a considerably large space in kitchen. For most people, they 
        would like to utilize every tiny space in their home. More things they could do 
        in the same space, the better it is. Therefore, it would strongly attracts potential 
        users if an oven product could do more, being multifunction and be even more professional. 
        <br><br>

        On the other hand, although combi oven can be used for cooking skills way more than simply just 
        steaming buns or bakery, most entry level users wouldn’t be able to think of it. Without actual 
        experience of using ovens for stews or gilled meals, beginners would often consider they might 
        only have very few occasions to use such product and therefore not worthy.
        <br><br>

        To convert such thoughts of combi oven can hardly be used, we think it is important to externalize 
        its ability, so that users can understand combi ovens can also be multifunction at their first glimpse. 
        Creating specialized features or accessories for specified cooking techniques could also help users to 
        imagine that they could get even more professional with the help of such product.
        <br><br>

        Therefore, we created oven accessories, such as stew pots, grill net, rotating grill to further externalize 
        its cooking techniques, making the multifunction feature of combi oven much more obvious to attract potential 
        customers.
